# Instructions

Create an small single-page application, and share your code using a Git repo.

You must create a weather logging app that allows users to enter temperatures in order to calculate its median, average, highest and lowest points.

You should NOT spend more than 1 day on this test. We do not expect you to complete every single user stories in that amount of time.

We will evaluate you based on:
- How clean your code is;
- The structure of your application;
- Your choice of UI architecture;

Don't forget to provide installation instructions with your project so we can run it for validation.

# User Stories:
- As a user, I want to add a temperature to my log
- The input must only take numbers
- You must display a validation error when invalid data is entered in the input
- As a user, I want to delete a temperature from my log
- As a user, I want to see the temperature median in my entire log
- As a user, I want to see the average temperature of my entire log
- As a user, I want to see the highest temperature in my log
- As a user, I want to see the lowest temperature in my log
